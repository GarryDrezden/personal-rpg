### Removed

- —

---

## Seasons v1

- Added 28-day season engine.
- Added 13 season configs.
- Added season quest progress from existing daily entries.
- Added partial success statuses.
- Added compact current season card to Today and Dashboard.
- Kept Boss Campaign, DB schema and new metrics out of scope.

---

## Core Loop Polish v1 — Today

- Improved daily Today flow.
- Added clearer save feedback and game reaction after saving.
- Improved minimal/recovery day presentation.
- Polished mobile Today experience.
- Kept storage and database schema unchanged.

---

## Onboarding v1 — Пробуждение ядра (polish)

- RPG tone copy per step (кампания / стартовая точка / облик героя / спутник / первый ритм).
- Mobile: sticky CTA, compact companions, safe-area padding, no horizontal scroll.
- Desktop: centered `max-w-md` ritual layout with ambient glow.
- Returning users redirected from `/start`; back navigation persists step for reload.
- Today welcome banner polish after route setup.

---

## Stabilize — Production Smoke / Auth Session

- Code review: cookie `Path=/`, `SameSite=Lax`, HttpOnly; Bearer + cookie dual auth.
- Fixed `/api/health.php` routing (`.htaccess` + `api/index.php` fallback).
- Logout clears local auth state even if API request fails.
- `AuthenticatedApp` init race guard; re-init on login via `authenticated` dependency.
- **Production smoke on HTTP (2026-07-02):** `http://fit-rpg.ru` — health OK, register/login/logout/me OK, `dailyEntries` + sidecars persist after re-login.
- Cookie on HTTP: `Set-Cookie` without `Secure` flag — matches `secure_cookie => false`.
- **HTTPS not configured yet** — `https://fit-rpg.ru` returns 404 nginx; recorded as future SSL hardening, not an app blocker.
- Manual browser checklist (reload UI, incognito): see [`11-shared-hosting-php-mysql-production.md`](wiki/11-shared-hosting-php-mysql-production.md).

---

## Stabilize — Remote Sidecar Persist

- Connected local sidecar progress to remote `user_data` storage.
- Achievements, coins and momentum now survive reload/login/device changes.
- Added guard against hydrate → save loops (`isSidecarHydrating`).
- Empty remote payload no longer overwrites existing local sidecar progress.
- Preserved local fallback for unauthenticated/offline usage.
- Re-init app data on login (`AuthenticatedApp` watches `authenticated`).
- Build and tests are green.

---

## Wiki / Game Design Update — Year Campaign Structure

- Added year campaign model for Personal RPG (`03-game-systems.md` → Year Campaign Structure).
- Defined day → week → season → chapter → act → campaign progression.
- Added 28-day seasons as the main long-term retention layer (~13 seasons/year).
- Added weekly quests and season quests as wrappers around existing daily actions.
- Added partial success model for seasons (no «5/5 or fail» logic).
- Added boss hierarchy: daily mobs, weekly elites, seasonal mini-bosses, chapter bosses, act bosses.
- Added boss weakening principle (real actions, not abstract damage).
- Added 13-season catalog as structural baseline for year one.
- Clarified that Boss Campaign is a future layer after core loop, Seasons v1, Body Abilities and Plateau Mode.
- Reinforced UX rule: the game must support return and progress, not become a body accounting system.
- Updated roadmap with correct implementation order: Stabilize → Onboarding → Core Loop Polish → Seasons v1 → …
